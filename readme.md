### Threshold
From [Wikipedia][threshold-wiki]: thresholding is the simplest method of segmenting images. The simplest thresholding methods replace each pixel in an image with a black pixel if the image intensity `I(i, j)` is less than some fixed constant T (that is, `I(i, j) < T`), or a white pixel if the image intensity is greater than that constant. In the example image on the right, this results in the dark tree becoming completely black, and the white snow becoming completely white.

See the result on the [browser][threshold-gp].
